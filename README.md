Although I have heard about the tough workload of Data Structures I am very excited to dig deeper into what we ended with on CPSC 231. Specifically I'm excited to learn and master sorting algorithms and master another language that I can add to my repertoire. I might not think it when I'm in the midst of it but right now I'm ready for the grind of big projects and really seeing the start of what I can do with computers.
